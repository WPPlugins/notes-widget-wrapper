== Description ==

**If you like Notes Widget Wrapper be sure to check out [WP Notes Widget]('https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-notes-widget/') as well!**

Notes Widget Wrapper wraps your widget in a "sticky note" style box and displays the text in a hand writing style. Although this plugin may work with numerous widgets, it has been developed with the intended use of applying a "sticky note" style to custom HTML content. The built in "Text" Wordpress widget and community contributed widgets like [Black Studio TinyMCE Widget]('https://wordpress.org/plugins/black-studio-tinymce-widget/') work great with Notes Widget Wrapper.
